# Data Acquisition and Processing Systems (DAPS) (ELEC0136)

Welcome to the material of the _Data Acquisition and Processing Systems_ (DAPS) course ELEC0136 at UCL.
We are going to use GitHub Classroom to manage the programming exercises and final assignment.
Since the final graded assignment will be managed through GitHub Classroom, it is strongly recommended to familiarise with the environment:
- How to use GitHub and GitHub classroom
- How to accept your assignments
- How to commit code with your solutions
- How to ask for help and review


## Using GitHub
If this is your first time using GitHub, it would be useful to complete the _Git & GitHub Fundamentals_ assignment at https://classroom.github.com/a/c5Me39XH.
This assignment illustrates the basic functionalities of GitHub and how to work with them.


## Accepting an assignment
Assignments will be distributed on the Moodle forum. You will find a link for each assignment. Once clicking on the link, you will have to accept the assignment. 
When accepting an assignment, you will receive a repository to work on, one for each assignment.
For example, if Katy accepted the assignment _DAPS 1: Data Acquisition_, Katy will receive a personal repository to work on it named `daps-1-data-acquisition-katy`, where `katy` is your GitHub username.


## Content of the assignment
The assignment is the `.ipynb` file in the repository. The repository also contains a password-protected `.zip` file with the solutions proposed by us.
The password will be discovered 2 weeks after each assignment has been released. Feel free to try brute-forcing it if you manage to :)


## Submitting your assignment
When accepting an assignment, you will not only receive a personal repository, but GitHub Classroom will also open a [Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for you. 
The PR is a place where we can exchange Questions and Answers about __your solution__ to the exercise.
To submit your assignment, please comment on the PR with `@epignatelli I submit!`. This way we will receive the notification you submitted and know that the assignment is completed.
Note that labs are not mandatory, but we they will prepare you to the final assignment with gathering experience in GitHub, programming, and learning the concepts you will encounter in the final one.


## Asking questions about the code
- To ask questions about __your solution__ please use your Pull Request.
- To report an problem in the code of the assignment we encourage to [__raise an issue__](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) on the __assignment repository__. For example, if Katy spots a problem in the assignment, they can raise an issue in their repository `daps-1-data-acquisition`. Note that this is not Katy's specific repository.  


## Asking questions about the lectures
To ask questions about the lectures, please use the Moodle course interface.


Enjoy your course, interact with your collegues, and see you at the final assignment.
